I confirm that I have participated in Iteration 3.  Mohammed Madan

I revised and  the use case descriptions Change the color theme, we recieved full marks for the back button so I didnt edit that case.
I wrote the entire new use case for place a piece and help write the difficulty case with max
I wrote the code for the timer and implement it with the diffuclty
I helped with the logical architecture diagram but rabia did most of the work
I edited the iteration plan 3 progress log with wang
